No, I didn't get the job.

I've certainly had my fair share of catastrophic interviews. The one where I mixed up whether the company used PHP or Perl. The lunch from which any testimony would have convicted my prospective employer of just about any [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/) lawsuit. The one where my would-be boss challenged the technical merit of the approach I'd co-designed and developed to handle complex radio routing requirements in life-and-death situations[^police].

[^police]: These were police radios, and officers relied on what I'd done to be able to talk reliably to different responders and agencies in a wide variety of scenarios. Sometimes, for example, they needed to temporarily switch channels and then have the radio automatically switch back in a few seconds, unless there was a manual request to switch to a different channel. The requirements for stitching together multiple incompatible radio systems were...special.

But being told I might not have enough energy for the job...that hurt.

I was tempted, of course, to just blow it off. And that might be the right answer. But as a teacher of mine once said, failure hurts, so you might as well squeeze every possible lesson out of it.

Part of why the feedback stings is because it ties into what I know is a weakness -- figuring out how to make the right first impression, the juggling act between confidence and arrogance, between listening well and giving answers in a time-limited scenario, showing appropriate interest while recognizing that the interview process is about discovering and evaluating unknowns.

And in this interview, I'd thought I'd found a balance of those traits that was really me and a good fit for the situation...only to get completely rejected.

# The interview

How did it all start? An acquaintance, Bob, who knew I was looking for a job, reached out. He had some openings and wanted to know if I might be interested. Our conversation went well, and I was invited out to see the company and see if there might be a fit.

This was all very informal. There was no job description, no hiring manager or recruiter, no details about the company other than what was publicly available. "Just" a chance to come in and chat[^technical].

[^technical]: At some point during my visit, there was also some time set aside for a technical evaluation. I don't remember if that was explicitly stated before the visit or not, but I'd certainly anticipated that happening. When chatting about the interview results, the company's feedback was that I'd nailed it technically (and that was my own assessment as well), so I've omitted the technical aspect of the interview as it doesn't seem relevant.

Arriving at the company, I met Bob and Bob's boss Charles. I'd carefully prepared to listen, to learn about what the company needed, and to see where there might be good synergy between my skills and their needs.

_"So what do you want to do for the company?"_

Charles asked that question a few minutes into the conversation. I had no idea; after all, that was supposed to be the whole point of the casual conversation? I tried to gently and diplomatically bounce the question back:

_"Part of why I'm here is to figure out what would make a great opportunity for both of us."_

At least, I tried to say something to that effect. Let's leave whether or not I was exactly that quick thinking on my feet to the imagination.

Charles was not happy, at least according to his body language. I tried to engage him and draw him out -- at least as well as I could while he and Bob were driving the interview questions. But Charles's body language continued to be hostile and disengaged.

And after perhaps half an hour, that was the interview. There was nothing casual or low-key about the conversation. Charles came across as hurried. He or Bob drove the conversation the whole time, and my efforts to create a back-and-forth exchange fell spectacularly flat.

 I'm not surprised I didn't get an offer, but being described as low energy surprised me.

# Lessons learned

One of the downsides of interviews is they are all special snowflakes. But here are a few of the takeaways that I've mulled over:

__Win__: _Going in with a loose game plan to listen and find mutual wins._

I like to make detailed plans. I like to know exactly what I'm getting into. I like having three or four contingency plans. Even though it worked out terribly in this scenario, I think going in with goals, some prepared questions to help me get to those goals, and the right mindset was the right approach.

__Win__: _Letting the company drive the interview._

Some of the interview advice I've heard more or less suggests that candidates take over the interview and run it. I have friends who can -- and have -- pulled that off in interviews.

But I find it disrespectful, especially when companies usually have crafted the interview process for their own evaluation process. I've rarely seen it done well in interviews when I'm the interviewer. Even though there was clearly more latitude here with a more informal process, I still don't think it's respectful to snatch control of the conversation.

__Win__: _Being prepared to drive the conversation._

I went in well prepared, if an opening was presented, to lead the conversation in learning what a win-win scenario might look like. I feel good about trying to establish a back-and-forth exchange within the confines of the interview format.

__Loss__: _Not openly (re)setting expectations._

In hindsight, I wish I had stopped a bit into the interview and said something like. "Bob, Charles, can we step back for a moment? My understanding is that I'm here so we can have a casual conversation about whether there's a position that would be a win-win scenario for both of us. Is that your understanding?"

I don't know what Charles was told. I don't know what Bob thought he'd told me. But it seems really likely that expectations were mismatched, and I wish I'd been quick thinking enough to have tried to make sure we were on the same page.

__Maybe__: _Not openly setting expectations before the visit._

As the saying goes, a good presentation consists of:
* Telling them what you are going to tell them.
* Telling them.
* Telling them what you've told them.

There's a lot of value in having a clear goal for any meeting, and I ponder if I should have dropped Bob a note a day or two before my meeting said something like, "Looking forward to getting together. In my mind, we're casually chatting to see if there's a win-win opportunity as well as doing some technical evaluation. Does that sound right?"

I don't know if it would have helped, but it might have made sure at least Bob and I were on the same page.

__Musing__: _Maybe energy wasn't the issue._

After mulling it over, I'm not entirely sure how to interpret Bob's low energy comment. There's the straight-forward interpretation -- I didn't come across as engaged during the interview. And that might be true, especially since I know I was trying to parse Charles's lack of engagement and figure out how to adjust. But I also ponder a couple other interpretations:

- _Charles doesn't like you, and the easiest way to describe his dislike is "low energy."_ Totally fair; it was pretty clear that Charles and I would be at least something of an acquired taste for each other. And depending on how aware Bob was of Charles's reaction and how openly Bob can speak about it, maybe "low energy" is as close as it gets.

- _We want employees who are really enthusiastic about the opportunity, even before they know anything about it._ I've run into this in other interviews -- employers often want people to be very excited about the opportunity before they've said much. In contrast, I tend to be very aware of how much is unknown and respond with cautious optimism.

# So what

My final thought is that, while it's great to wring as many lessons as possible from failure -- and preferably the failure of others, because it is a whole lot less painful than going through it myself -- at the end of the day, interviews can't be taken too seriously.

Almost by definition, everyone has more losses than wins when it comes to interviewing: You keep interviewing until you take a job. And for all that one tries to put their best foot forward, so much can go wrong that is totally not under one's control. Sometimes people won't understand you, and that's okay. Learn to get a good laugh out of it -- or at least a blog article -- and move on.

What do you think? What lessons would you have taken away from such an interview?
