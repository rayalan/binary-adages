> __Critical thinking__. Alan is exceptionally talented at thinking about all aspects of a problem and having a good understanding of situations relayed to him. It seems to be easy for him to even grasp the complexity of subjects he is not familiar with at a glance.
>
> __Runs toward gunfire__. Wherever there's a hard problem â€” young developers needing growth, hiring to be done, tools to be created, outages, new product features being contemplated, Alan is throwing himself into the fray, helpfully, expending seeming inexhaustible energy helping to resolve the problem.
>
> __Structurally-minded__. Bringing order from chaos. This manifests in Alan's helping to improve hiring processes, development processes, team structures, company business rules, adapting to team changes, and similar.

Hello. Do you need...

* A [100x software architect](https://www.stxnext.com/blog/software-development-productivity-100x-engineering/) who can connect the business objectives to the engineering culture and practices through to the day-to-day practices?
* A deep critical thinker and problem solver who can challenge assumptions, find out-of-the-box alternatives, and simplify complex problems -- all in pursuit of the underlying goal?
* A versatile software architect with decades of experience across cloud, SaaS, embedded, and application environments?
* A skilled communicator and leader with a proven track record for leading change at any level of the organization?
* A mentor who brings pragmatic structure, excellence, and independence to those around him?

If so, let's [talk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-ray-3513aa14/).

# Fun fact

I love learning about other fields, including user experience, information architecture, artificial intelligence[^org] safety[^safety], and military logistics[^perun].

[^org]: AI algorithms with divergent interests remind me a lot of organizations (e.g. engineering departments) and how individual interests don't always align with the business objective.

[^safety]: One of my favorite college classes was an algorithm class where the professor challenged us to think, "Suppose that your nemesis was designing the input for your algorithm -- what's the worst that he could do?" I was (and continue to be) very good at that game, and AI safety has a similar vibe: What's the worst that an intelligent opponent can do with a particular set of restrictions? [Robert Miles AI Safety](https://www.youtube.com/c/robertmilesai) is an excellent introduction to such perils.

[^perun]: [Perun](https://www.youtube.com/@PerunAU) has a fascinating channel on modern military logistics, especially those of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many of the principles apply to software development as well, fortunately with less catastrophic twists. Also, his channel is a fascinating example of counter-intuitive results -- in an era of fancy videos and click bait, he's grown his channel to 100K+ views per video by doing powerpoint presentations with a healthy dose of humor.
