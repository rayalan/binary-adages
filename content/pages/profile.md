Hello. I'm a [100x software architect](https://www.stxnext.com/blog/software-development-productivity-100x-engineering/) who creates amazing engineering teams that deliver high-quality software, working alongside similarly minded leadership. I'm a jack-of-all-trades engineer with decades of software development experience and multi-disciplinary interests that span user experience, information architecture, artificial intelligence[^org] safety[^safety], and military logistics[^perun].

[^org]: AI algorithms with divergent interests remind me a lot of organizations (e.g. engineering departments) and how individual interests don't always align with the business objective.

[^safety]: One of my favorite college classes was an algorithm class where the professor challenged us to think "Suppose that your nemesis was designing the input for your algorithm -- what's the worst that he could do?" I was (and continue to be) very good at that game, and AI safety has a similar vibe: What's the worst that an intelligent opponent can do with a particular set of restrictions? [Robert Miles AI Safety](https://www.youtube.com/c/robertmilesai) is an excellent introduction to such perils.


[^perun]: [Perun](https://www.youtube.com/@PerunAU) has a fascinating channel on modern military logistics, especially those of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many of the principles apply to software development as well, fortunately with less catastrophic twists. Also, his channel is a fascinating example of counter-intuitive results -- in an era of fancy videos and click bait, he's grown his channel to 100K+ views per video by doing powerpoint presentations with a healthy dose of humor.


- Analyze plans, objectives, and systems refining and overhauling to be consistent from business goals down to the day-to-day datails in both the short and long term. Provide options and trade-offs in both business plans and technical designs.
- Communicator (technical and non-technical)
- Initiative.
- Focused.
- Mentor those around me in both technically and professionally.
- Structure and organize both the technical and process aspects of engineering.
- Quick learner, growing my knowledge across a variety of disciplines and rapidly adapting different approaches to changing scenarios.
- Pragmatic hands-on approach to design and architecture.
- Reach careful considered solutions based on thoughtful investigation and inquiry.

> In short, I love doing what's described in these [staff engineering architypes](https://lethain.com/staff-engineer-archetypes/) or this ["startup CTO" description](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/what-does-startup-cto-actually-do.html).

Beyond that, I'm a versatile developer and conscientious manager[^manager] who can manage technically-complex projects in the middle of chaos and crisis[^hats].

[^manager]: I hesistate to say I am a great manager -- see [this post]({filename}/my-best-managers.md) for my idea of great managers -- but I'm deeply gratified that my reports consistently give me high marks (TODO LINK).

[^hats]: Throughout much of my career, I've worn multiple hats in most of my positions, often operating informally far beyond what my title would suggest.
