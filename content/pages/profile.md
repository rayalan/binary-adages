[TOC]

Hello. I'm a [100x software architect](https://www.stxnext.com/blog/software-development-productivity-100x-engineering/) who creates amazing engineering teams that deliver high-quality software, working alongside similarly minded leadership. I'm a jack-of-all-trades engineer with decades of software development experience and multi-disciplinary interests that span user experience, information architecture, artificial intelligence[^org] safety[^safety], and military logistics[^perun].





With decades of software development experience,



 software engineer

## My questions for an employer

[^org]: AI algorithms with divergent interests remind me a lot of organizations (e.g. engineering departments) and how individual interests don't always align with the business objective.

[^safety]: One of my favorite college classes was an algorithm class where the professor challenged us to think "Suppose that your nemesis was designing the input for your algorithm -- what's the worst that he could do?" I was (and continue to be) very good at that game, and AI safety has a similar vibe: What's the worst that an intelligent opponent can do with a particular set of restrictions? [Robert Miles AI Safety](https://www.youtube.com/c/robertmilesai) is an excellent introduction to such perils.


[^perun]: [Perun](https://www.youtube.com/@PerunAU) has a fascinating channel on modern military logistics, especially those of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many of the principles apply to software development as well, fortunately with less catastrophic twists. Also, his channel is a fascinating example of counter-intuitive results -- in an era of fancy videos and click bait, he's grown his channel to 100K+ views per video by doing powerpoint presentations with a healthy dose of humor.
