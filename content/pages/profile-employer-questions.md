Successfully searching for a ~~software engineering~~ position resolves two questions:

* Does the employer want to hire you?
* Do you want to work for the employer?

While every job has its rough points -- or _[where there's muck, there's brass](https://wordhistories.net/2021/11/04/where-muck-brass/)_ as the saying goes -- the goal is to find a compelling long-term match. Over time, then, I've built up my own set of questions[^posthog] to ask employers. I don't explicitly ask all of these questions during the interview process, but they frame what I want to learn about potential employers.

[^posthog]: PostHog has an [excellent article](https://posthog.com/blog/what-to-ask-in-interviews) on key interview questions; many of these are drawn from there.

_Understand what the company's foundational footing is like ..._

## Product

* Do you ever question if you have product-market fit?
* When did you reach product-market fit? How did you know?
* What do you need to do to get to product-market fit?

[^daily]: Adjust this question based on the company / product; this variant is designed around a SaaS-oriented company.
