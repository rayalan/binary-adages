I'm primarily not:
  - A marketer / self-promotional.
  - Charasmatic (cheer)leader
  -

Build trust <--> Link business strategy <--> Long-term choices (e.g. hiring, tech stack) <--> Short-term goals (e.g. ship X, improve Y)

Polygot

Mistake Monday
  - UX Advisor Hire
    Didn't explain the problem well
    Didn't take myself seriously
    Took the rules too seriously
  - Build Frogger
  - Centralized build systems (frozen in state)
  - Weaknesses (commraderie, encouragement, ...)

Principles and Practices:
  - Speed of loop
  - Innovation tokens
  - Cost vs. Speed vs. Quality
  - Conways Law
  - Measurement and Feedback
  - Can you build it? --> Should you build it?
  - Man Month (value of adding people)
  - Error-handling strategies (can you avoid it, for example? Human intervention)
  - Discernment: Trade-offs of principles

Principles
  - Testability
  - Speed of Loops
  - Fundamental Trade-offs
  - Scaling
  - Transitions

Stripe : Exemplar
  Pros
    Webhooks w/retry
    Errors (logging, events)
    Appropriate Abstractions --> UX,
    Sandboxing
    Iterations
    Customer Fit
    Codefree solutions
    Documentation
    Good technical resources (once paid)
    Good iterations
    Legacy support
    Metadata (nosql w/transactions)

  Cons
    Complex edge cases not handled well
    Hidden functionality
    Pay-to-play
    Slow to provide key improvements (e.g. search api, test clocks)

Topics: Retrospectives at different levels. - developer vs. manager vs. executive
  Information density


24 Topics:
- 1. The greatest challenge: Change over time
  - Expectations change
  - People build up expectations
  - Continuous data
  - Goals change
  - Scope changes
- 2. The problem of process:
  - Hard to change because it involves people
  - People have other interests (e.g. personal goals)
  - People can only absorb so much change
- 3. Iterative improvement: Local optimal vs. big improvement
  - How far can local optimal go?
- 4. The problem of calibration - what makes for great engineering in a particular situation?
  - Low vs. high volume APIs
  - Embedded vs. SaaS.
  - Speed vs. risk vs. uncertainty vs. ???.
- 5. Business processes and the similarities to AI optiimzations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJLcIBixGj8
  - (See also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w65p_IIp6JY)
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeecOKBus3Q
- 6. What level of confidence? The challenge of guarantees
  - Can you guarantee outcomes given all normal output? (not just typical input). Do you know what the full range of typical input is?
  - What will happen as people start to respond to incentivizes? (First you build your tools, then your tools define you.)
  - What happens if an adversary designs a malicious input?
- 7. Optimizing engineering:
  - People + Processes + Technical Choices ==> Work
  - Ideally, Work ==> Business goals
  - In reality, Work ==> Personal goals, and personal goals =/= business goals
  - (and customer goals =/= personal goals =/= business goals)
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nktr1MgS-A) - the problem of goal alignment (and AGI's more generally)
- 8. Chesteron's Fence
  - The problem of knowledge loss (why was this decision made? has the situation changed? who still knows this? what are the ramifications of this decision now?)
- 9. Great managers - Patrick and Scott
- 10. Nemesis - what's the worst thing that could happen?
  - See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdVC4e6EV4
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUO6pjwFOo
- 11. Problem of goal alignment
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TYT1QfdfsM (AI stop button problem)
- 12. Retrospectives and the problem of scope
  - Blame-free retrospectives
  - What is the scope of the problem? Individual? Team? Architecture? Department? C-level incentives?
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nktr1MgS-A )Stop button solution 2
- 13. User Experience, Search, and Home Depot (23/32" plywood)
  - Does the difference matter? A contractor might care, but as a novice, I may not.
- 14. The problem of sizing.
  - Monolith (monorepo), microservice, lambdas function soup. Trade-offs between ease of change and correctness.
- 15. The problem of knowing what you know
  - Hard to see the whole picture...
  - ...create a metric (which approximates some of the knowledge at least for a while)
  - ...but easy for the metric to not contain everything it should, or to diverge from reality
  - [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)
- 16. What is important in software engineering?
  - Molly rocket https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YpFGkG-u1w
  - WAMED (write, agree, read, modify, execute, debug)
- ??. "Nobody claims to have an inefficient unfun engineering team."
   - Looking busy vs. what the company cares about. The importance of looking importance. What is most important?
- ?? How do you align incentives: Department vs. individual. vs. business
- ??. Most important questions: Why and so what? But is that really the case?
- Software development is a corporate process, not just an engineering process. c.f. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SScjUIU-Fkg
- Learning - what kind of learning is useful?
  - Value of learning it self.
  - Learning disconnected from theory (e.g. always learning better ways of doing C++ pointers) -- but is that what engineering needs? Is that what the organization needs?
- Conventional wisdom - is anybody actually doing it? Is no one is actually doing it, is it actually the right way to do software? If you want to be world-class, you need to defy conventional wisdom. Standard operating procedures will only get you...standard results.
- Selection bias - gradually narrowing
- Tenets; architectural principles, design principles + practices
- Debate principles (see draft from other blog)
- The importance of vocabulary.
- Pscological safety - never having to explain yourself vs. the ability to speak until you've explained yourself.
- How do you calibrate yourself to a job?
- the complexity of tech world
  - what do certifications tell you?
  - The value of certifications vs. the value of someone who can learn
  - the value of tasks vs. the value of determining which approach needs to be taken and thus which tasks need to be done. Doing the right thing vs. doing the thing right.

      - Flourish with compensating strengths - advocates and high-trust, freedom, people who can help read emotions.
      - Hyper-responsible (ability to see complexity) - juggling too many competing priorities or trying to get people to agree to reset them rather than just silently ignoring past commitments.
